Question No 1

Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths.

Solution :

Equilateral: It's a triangle with 3 sides of equal length.
Isosceles: It's a triangle with 2 sides of equal length.
Scalene: It's a triangle with 3 sides of differing lengths.
Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.

Use a case statement to identify the shape of a triangle based on the above-mentioned rules.

Select 
  Case
      when A+B <= C or A+C <= B or B+C <=1 then 'Not A Triangle'
      when A = B and B = C then 'Equilateral'
      when A = B or B = C or C = A then 'Isosceles'
      when A != B and B!=C then 'Scalene'
 End as shapes

Question No 2

--Query an alphabetically ordered list of all names in OCCUPATIONS, immediately followed by the first letter of each profession as a parenthetical. Query the number of occurrences of each occupation in OCCUPATIONS.
--Solution :
Use Concat to generate the required output along with order by and group by

Select concat (Name, '(', upper(Substring(Occupation,1,1)),')')
from OCCUPTATIONS
order by Name;

Select concat ('There are a total of ', Count(Occupation),' ',lower(Occupation),'s.')
from OCCUPATIONS
group by Occupation
order by Count (Occupation) ASC;
